# Hi, I'm Brian!


I'm a senior currently studying at the University of California, Berkeley, majoring in computer science and minoring in English. 

Besides schoolwork, I research CS education in the Algorithms for Computing and Education (ACE) lab at Berkeley. 

This coming fall, I'll be starting work full-time at Facebook.
